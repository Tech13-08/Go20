# Go20

A program to help you in following the 20-20-20 rule: Look 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* None! Besides an OS of course: Windows/MacOS/Linus are all fine as long as it can handle automating tasks.

### Installing

* Click the `main.exe` file and download it. 

### Executing program

- Windows
> * Open the `Task Scheduler` using the search or start menu.
> * Create a `new task` and follow this template for the setup
>
> 
>  * The only important setting here is the `Run only when user is logged on`. This must be enabled or else you won't see the window. The other settings on this tab are up to preference.

>   
>   
> *  Under the `Trigger` tab, make a new trigger and follow every setting here exactly as shown. The goal is to repeat the task every 20 minutes automatically.

> * That's it! Everything should work automatically now. If you see nothing, right click the tast you just made and click `run` just in case.
> * If you ever want to disable/enable this program, that is also an option found by right clicking the task you just made.
